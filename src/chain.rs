//! Skyline writes a hook as a one-word `b`, or as a far jump `ldr x17, #8;
//! br x17; .quad target` (16 bytes), with a `nop` first at an address 4 past
//! an 8-byte boundary (20 bytes). At a site this plugin hooks:
//!
//! - another plugin's far jump: this plugin's hook goes on a small stub
//!   instead, which then jumps on to that plugin's handler through x17 as the
//!   far jump did (Skyline must not relocate the jump's address word as code);
//! - another plugin's one-word branch: Skyline relocates it into this
//!   plugin's trampoline, which works only if this hook is a one-word branch
//!   too (checked; otherwise the words are put back);
//! - other plugins' hooks further into the 64 checked bytes: accepted;
//! - anything else: the site is left alone.
//!
//! Where a plugin only calls a function, or relies on an instruction in
